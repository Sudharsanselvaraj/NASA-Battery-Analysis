# NASA Battery Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the NASA Battery Dataset, focusing on battery performance parameters such as voltage, current, temperature, and impedance over multiple cycles. The dataset is used to assess various battery behaviors, including electrolyte resistance (Re) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) across different cycles.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
1. Analyze the performance of batteries by evaluating important parameters.
2. Visualize the changes in battery characteristics over different cycles.
3. Provide insights into battery degradation, which can be used for future improvements in battery technology.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.6+
- Google Colab (for running the notebook)
- Required Python Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `plotly`
  - `zipfile`
  - `os`

You can install the necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly
